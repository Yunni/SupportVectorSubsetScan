# Support Vector Subset Scan

Support Vector Subset Scan is an unsurpervised machine learning algorithm to detect a random shaped subset using Linear Time Subset Scan (D Neill 2011) and the kernel trick. This is the code for Support Vector Subset Scan running on a generated dataset.

(1)    Please download stprtool (http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/cmp/software/stprtool/) and add it to path.

(2)    Please run main.m using Matlab or Octave

(3)    Open main.m and the parameters are all in the “options”
